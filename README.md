# Bike-Sharing-XGBoost
Bike sharing systems are a means of renting bicycles where the process of obtaining membership, rental, and bike return is automated via a network of kiosk locations throughout a city.
I used Extreme Gradient Boosting which provides a parallel tree boosting that solve many data science problems in a fast and accurate way. XGBoost manages only numeric vectors. So it Conversion from categorical to numeric variables using one-hot encoding. I used a vtreat package to perform this. Caret is used instead of base packages.
